Contributers:
Flutter Side : Me
Java Side: Pranav Ratnalikar
Hardware:Tejas Hirve

## Introduction: 
The project was conceived to tackle the persistent issue of poor working conditions for low-skilled labourers, both locally and internationally. The tragic deaths of Indian workers in Qatar underscored the urgent need for safer working environments globally. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated livelihood challenges for these vulnerable groups, highlighting the importance of innovative solutions that can facilitate safer and more efficient working conditions.

## Purpose
The project aims to address the challenges faced by low-skilled labourers and customers by creating a platform that enhances accessibility, efficiency in job matching, and ensures safer working conditions through innovative technologies.

# Project Overview
![labourer_worker_flow](https://github.com/ANUJT65/Yojna_2.0/assets/123918593/72d774af-817f-4f8f-830c-4972183eaaab)


## Project Description
The project has 2 sides one is developed in flutter which is labourer side and one is developed in java which is customer side, we have effectively integrated 2 different technologies through this project achieving seamless connectivity between the 2 sides.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: For developing the laborer-side mobile application.
- **Java**: For developing the customer-side application.
- **Firebase**: Used as a centralized database for storing worker locations, job preferences, and facilitating communication between laborer and customer sides.
- **Text-to-Speech Module**: Integrated into the Flutter application to enhance accessibility.
- **Gemini-based Chatbot**: Implemented in the laborer-side application for legal assistance.
- **IoT Sensors**: For monitoring environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and worker heart rate in real-time.
